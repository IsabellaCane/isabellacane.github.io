          FUCK CONTENT <strong>|</strong> </div>
        <div class="content">
          In Designer as Author I argued that we are insecure about the value of our work. We are
          envious of the power, social position and cachet that artists and authors seem to
          command. By declaring ourselves "designer/authors" we hope to garner similar respect.
          Our deep-seated anxiety has motivated a movement in design that values origination of
          content over manipulation of content.<br><br>
          Designer as Author was an attempt to recuperate the act of design itself as essentially
          linguistic a vibrant, evocative language. However, it has often been read as a call for
          designers to generate content: in effect, to become designers and authors, not
          designers as authors. While I am all for more authors, that was not quite the point I
          wanted to make.<br><br>
          The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design
          is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-followsfunction
          is reconfigured as form-follows-content. If content is the source of form, always
          preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even
          possible) is some kind of empty shell.<br><br>
          The apotheosis of this notion, repeated ad nauseum (still!), is Beatrice Warde's famous
          Crystal Goblet metaphor, which asserts that design (the glass) should be a transparent
          vessel for content (the wine). Anyone who favored the ornate or the bejeweled was a
          knuckle-dragging oaf. Agitators on both sides of the ideological spectrum took up the
          debate: minimalists embraced it as a manifesto; maximalists decried it as aesthetic
          fascism. Neither camp questioned the basic, implicit premise: it's all about the wine.<br><br>
          This false dichotomy has circulated for so long that we have started to believe it
          ourselves. It has become a central tenet of design education and the benchmark
          against which all design is judged. We seem to accept the fact that developing content
          is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design.<br><br>
          Back when Paul Rand wrote "There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form," I
          remember being intensely annoyed. I took it as an abdication of a designer's
          responsibility to meaning. Over time, I have come to read it differently: he was not
          defending hate speech or schlock or banality; he meant that the designer's purview is to
          shape, not to write. But that shaping itself is a profoundly affecting form. (Perhaps this is
          the reason that modern designers Rand, Munari, Leoni always seem to end their
          careers designing children's books. The children's book is the purest venue of the
          designer/author because the content is negligible and the evocative potential of the form
          unlimited.)?<br><br><br>

          So what else is new? This seems to be a rather mundane point, but for some reason we
          don't really believe it. We don't believe shaping is enough. So to bring design out from
          under the thumb of content we must go one step further and observe that treatment is,
          in fact, a kind of text itself, as complex and referential as any traditional understanding
          of content. <br><br>
          A director can be the esteemed auteur of a film he didn't write, score, edit or shoot.
          What makes a Hitchcock film a Hitchcock film is not the story but a consistency of style,
          which winds intact through different technologies, plots, actors, and time periods like a
          substance of its own. Every film is about filmmaking. His great genius is that he is able
          to mold the form into his style in a genuinely unique and entertaining way. The meaning
          of his work is not in the story but in the storytelling.<br><br>
          Designers also trade in storytelling. The elements we must master are not the content
          narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale,
          weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines.<br><br>
          The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. Form has evolved
          dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually
          revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. Stellar examples of
          graphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in
          service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or
          machinery. Think of Piet Zwart's catalogues for electrical cable; or the travel posters of
          Cassandre or Matter; or the New Wave work of Weingart, Greiman and Freidman; or
          the punk incitations of Jamie Reid, in which the manipulation of form has an essential,
          even transformative, meaning.<br><br><br>

            </center>
          At a 1962 conference at the Museum of Modern Art, conservative art critic Hilton
          Kramer denounced Pop Art as "indistinguishable from advertising art" because "Pop Art
          does not tell us what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization.
          Its social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities, banalities and
          vulgarities." But perhaps the content of graphic design is exactly that: an evocation of
          "what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization," with all its
          "commodities, banalities and vulgarities." How else can we discuss the content of a
          typeface or why the typography of a surfing magazine suddenly becomes relevant? Or
          how a series of made-up or 'self-initiated' posters already a medium of dubious
          functionality can end up on the wall of a major design museum? Work must be saying
          something, which is different than being about something.<br><br>
          Because the nature of the designed object is limited, individual objects are rarely
          substantial enough to contain fully rendered ideas. Ideas develop over many projects,
          spanning years. Form itself is indexical. We are intimately, physically connected to the
          work we produce, and it is inevitable that our work bears our stamp. The choice of
          projects in each designer's oeuvre lays out a map of interests and proclivities. (I use the
          singular designer in the categorical sense, not the individual.) The way those projects
          are parsed out, disassembled, reorganized and rendered reveals a philosophy, an
          aesthetic position, an argument and a critique.<br><br>
          This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the
          user and the world. By manipulating form, design reshapes that essential relationship.
          Form is replaced by exchange. The things we make negotiate a relationship over which
          we have a profound control.<br><br>
          The trick is to find ways to speak through treatment, via a range of rhetorical devices?
          from the written to the visual to the operational to make those proclamations as
          poignant as possible, and to return consistently to central ideas, to re-examine and reexpress.
          In this way we build a body of work, and from that body of work emerges a
          singular message, maybe even what it feels like to be living now. As a popular film critic
          once wrote, "A movie is not what it is about, it's how it is about it." Likewise, for us,
          ourWhat is a How. Our content is, perpetually, Design itself.<br><br>

        THE DEMISE OF FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION <strong>|</strong> </div>
        <div class="content">
          If there was a (booby) prize for the most misused design cliché, a firm favorite would be “form follows function,” with “less is more” coming a close second.<br><br>
          Not only is “form follows ...” often quoted incorrectly, it is not even accurate: the original wording was “form ever follows function.” It is also routinely misattributed, mostly to 20th-century modernist grandees, like Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, but was actually coined by the less famous American architect, Louis Sullivan.<br><br>
          Misused though Sullivan’s quote has been, his point, that the style of architecture should reflect its purpose, made sense at the time, and continued to do so for much of the last century, not just for buildings, but objects too. That was then. Thanks to digital technology, designers can squeeze so many functions into such tiny containers that there is more computing power in a basic cellphone (not a fancy model, like a BlackBerry or iPhone, just a cheap one) than at NASA’s headquarters when it began in 1958. That is why the appearance of most digital products bears no relation to what they do.<br><br>
          Take the iPod Shuffle. How could you be expected to guess what that tiny metal box does by looking at it? There are no clues to suggest that it might play music. Like most other digital devices, the Shuffle is (literally) an inscrutable box of tricks. Apple’s designers conceived the latest model as a subtle joke on the demise of “form follows ...” It is so small, half the size of its predecessor, that they could make it in the same shape as one of those pins that clip on to clothing. This means the Shuffle’s form does reflect one of its functions, albeit the very minor one of attaching itself to a jacket, but gives no hint as to its more important role of storing and playing hundreds of songs.<br><br>
          Joking aside, the dislocation of form and function has set a new challenge for designers: how to help us to operate ever more complex digital products. In ye olden days when form did follow function, you could guess roughly how to use an object from its appearance. But our ability to work out how to download and play music on a Shuffle is largely determined by the design quality of the software that operates it — the “user interface” in geek-speak, or “U.I.” If the “U.I.” is well designed, you should be able to use the device so intuitively that you will not have to think about it. But if it is badly designed, the process will seem so confusing that you will probably blame yourself for doing something wrong.<br><br>
          That is why the first wave of U.I. designs sought to reassure us by using visual references to familiar objects to help us to operate digital ones. Take the typewriter keyboards on computers, and video game controllers modeled on TV remote control pads. As our confidence has grown, U.I. design has become more sophisticated, increasingly relating to our physical behavior, rather than objects.<br><br>
          One landmark is Nintendo’s Wii games system, which is operated by replicating the movements we would make if playing for real: from firing a “gun,” to whacking a “tennis ball” with a “racquet.” Another is Apple’s iPhone, which replaced the traditional keyboard with a touch-sensitive screen that achieves a similar effect to the Wii by responding to the natural movements of our hands. The same goes for the thousands of applications, or “apps,” invented for the iPhone, mostly by amateur programmers. Over a billion apps have been downloaded in the last nine months, and one reason for their popularity is that they feel so instinctive. An example is “Brushes,” the $4.99 app with which the artist Jorge Colombo “drew” the cover of the June 1 edition of The New Yorker on his iPhone by creating digital layers of “paint” with his fingers, just as if he was making brushstrokes on a canvas.<br><br>
          The next phase of U.I. design will take this further. John Maeda, the software designer and president of the Rhode Island School of Design, believes that our current “awkward mechanical dance” with computers will be replaced by an intuitive approach. “It will need to be more improvisational,” he said. “There will be a need for more subtlety and grayness.”<br><br>
          One possibility is what techies call human interaction systems. An example is g-speak, which is now being developed by Los Angeles-based Oblong Industries as a means of operating computers through physical movements and gestures, rather than keyboards and mice. Think of how Tom Cruise “controlled” computers remotely in the 2002 movie “Minority Report.” The students at the Rhode Island School of Design did that this spring in experiments with g-speak.<br><br>
          Another option is to swap physical means of controlling technology with voice recognition systems, which are already used in some devices, or pure intuition. San Francisco-based Emotiv Systems worked with the IDEO design group to develop the Epoc, a headset that enables you to play video games by monitoring electrical activity in your brain. It literally reads your mind through 16 sensors, which then relay your instructions to the console. “People are always ready for new or better or more sophisticated experiences — digital and physical,” said Kara Johnson, a material scientist at the IDEO design group. “The role of the designer is to make them simple and meaningful.”<br><br>
          Others are skeptical that voice recognition and brain sensor technology will ever be reliable enough to replace physical controls. “They work ‘sometimes,’ but ‘sometimes’ isn’t enough for most people,” explained Mr. Maeda. “But I’m the guy who thought in the early 1990s that making home pages on something called the World Wide Web was a silly idea, which would never catch on.”<br><br>

          THE ART OF TYPE: READING BETWEEN THE LINES <strong>|</strong> </div>
        <div class="content">
        <strong>Properly set leading is vital to harmonious page layouts and, more importantly, readability.</strong><br><br>
        Leading is an aspect of white-space management that gets far too little attention. Properly set leading is vital to harmonious page layouts and, more importantly, readability. It’s a key element in the even texture we call “good type color.”<br><br>
        Now, when I use the term, “leading,” I’m using the mainstream definition: the distance, in points, from the baseline of one character to the baseline of the line of text above it. The word comes from the lead alloy used to create the metal stamping blocks in handset type. The vertical dimension of the face of these blocks equals the point size of the type. The computer-type equivalent is the height of the bounding box that surrounds each character you set.<br><br>
        In computer type as in metal type, when you set lines of these character blocks one on top of another with no added intervening space, you’re setting your type solid. When you add space between lines, you’re adding lead. In a solid set, the type’s point size and leading are equal, for example, when 12-point type is set on 12 points of lead. This is typically written 12/12, pronounced “12 on 12.” Adding 1 point of lead gives you 12/13, or “12 on 13.”<br><br>
        <strong>Just say “no” to automatic leading</strong><br>
        The first step to asserting control over your leading is changing the “automatic leading” value in all your programs. In the absence of a decision by you, this value determines what your leading will be, based on the size of your type. Never surrender this decision to a computer program! But since the “automatic” option exists, you may as well set it to a useful value.<br><br>
        In all Adobe programs, the default value for automatic leading is 120% of your type size. Sometimes this may be appropriate, but it’s like having a broken watch: It’s accurate twice a day, but useless the rest of the time. It’s far better to have “automatic” leading default to a logical integer value that’s the same as your type size.<br><br>
        With no documents open, open your program’s Paragraph panel, click on its menu (top right of the panel), and choose Justification. In the Justification dialog, change the Auto Leading value to 100% and click OK. Thenceforth, your automatic leading will produce a solid set. If you forget to specify a leading value, this has the merit of usually being more noticeably wrong than a 120% setting, which may be just close enough to being correct as to go unnoticed.<br><br>
        <strong>Getting the lead in </strong><br>
        So what leading value should you select? Since there should be harmony among the proportions of all the white space systems on your page—tracking, gutter width, measure (and by inference, margin width)—the answer is, “It depends.” One thing to know is that in most cases, leading measured in whole- or half-point increments serves perfectly well. Using fractions finer than a half-point is really a case of splitting hairs, and is unlikely to accomplish anything.<br><br>
        The most important factor in determining a proper leading value is your type’s measure, or line length. Here’s a handy rule of thumb: When your type size (in points) equals your measure (in picas), a solid set usually works fine; for example, 12-point type over a 12-pica measure. When your measure (in picas) is twice your point size (in points), add 1 point of lead. When this ratio goes to 3:1, add two points of lead. This doesn’t always work, but it will get you close.<br><br>
        There are two reasons to increase leading as you increase your measure. First, the space between lines serves as a path to steer your readers’ eyes from the right margin back to the left so they can start reading the next line. Narrow leading makes this transit more difficult. Second, tight leading in a wide column simply makes the text block look gray and uninviting—suffocating.<br><br>
        The point size you choose makes a lesser difference. As point size increases, so does the amount of negative space in and around the characters. Both character and word spacing appear somewhat looser. The type appears to have more breathing room. This can allow you to use slightly tighter leading in large type. But generally, your choice of point size is related to the measure you use, which brings us back to the previous point.<br><br>
        A more important consideration is the choice of typeface itself. Most seriffed typefaces for text are so-called “old-style,” which have a moderate amount of contrast between their thick and thin strokes and work with the rule-of-thumb for leading outlined above. But so-called “modern” faces, such as Bodoni and Didot, have much greater contrast, with exaggerated thin strokes, giving them a brightness on the page that somewhat diminishes their readability. They also have large counters, the open spaces in characters such as o and a, which give them an airy appearance on the page. Just as these faces suffer from tight tracking, they suffer from tight leading, because this fights against the openness of the letterforms themselves. Adding lead helps.<br><br>
        Likewise, sans-serif faces used in text settings, as on this page, also suffer when set with tight tracking and leading. In this case, it’s because sans-serif faces are inherently somewhat less legible than seriffed faces (serifs provide visual clues for quick character recognition), so tight tracking slows reading. Along with the looser character fitting that typifies sans-serif faces must come looser leading as well.<br><br>
        <strong>A character attribute?</strong><br>
        In Adobe programs, leading is nominally a character attribute set in the Character panel. But this is badly implemented. To see how badly, select a single character in the middle of a paragraph and double its leading value and you’ll see that the whole line takes on the leading of that single character. Bad! Your supposed character attribute is in fact a line attribute. If leading were properly implemented as a character attribute, doubling that character’s leading would simply push that one character down until its baseline was the specified distance below that of the previous line.<br><br>
        To move single characters up and down like this in Adobe programs, you have to use the Baseline Shift command, which is a half-baked implementation of true character-based leading.<br><br>
        <strong>Negative leading</strong><br>
        Computerized typesetting introduced negative leading, where your leading value is less than your type’s point size. It’s rarely useful in body text, but it’s often handy in display settings. That’s because as point size increases, white space appears to grow faster than the characters themselves. As “normal” tracking looks too loose in large sizes, so does “normal” leading. As long as ascending and descending characters don’t collide, you can use negative leading to good effect in headlines and titles, especially in all-caps or caps-and-small-caps matter.<br><br>
        One last point: Nobody said leading has to be consistent within a single passage of display type, either. When one line of type lacks ascenders, for example, its leading will appear to be greater than other lines in the text block (as shown here). The absence of ascenders and descenders between the first two lines of the upper sample (set in 24/24 Bodoni Bold) make the leading seem wider than that between the last two lines. In the lower sample, the leading of the second line has been reduced to 22 points, creating the effect of more balanced spacing.<br><br>
        Likewise, a line with few or no descenders can make the leading of the following line look too slack. Don’t be afraid to select these lines and (using the so-called character attribute as a line attribute) tweak the leading until the spacing between all the lines looks even. Because in type, what looks right is right.

          DESIGN IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL FORCES IN OUR LIVES<strong>|</strong> </div>
          <div class="content">
            <strong>A new book from critic Alice Rawsthorn explains how graphic, product, and interactive design help—and sometimes unintentionally hinder—humans.</strong><br><br>
            “Do you ring a doorbell with a finger or a thumb?” That’s the kind of question Alice Rawsthorn, design critic for The International New York Times, asks when she thinks about design—all design—and the major role designers have in altering our lives.
            Her answer, however, reveals a lot about how she thinks of design’s evolution. “The older you are, the likelier you will be to press it with a finger, probably your index finger,” she writes in her latest book of essays, Hello World: Where Design Meets Life. “If you are younger, you may well use a thumb, because it will have been exercised so thoroughly by typing text messages and gunning down digital assailants on game consoles that it is likely to be stronger and nimbler than any of your fingers.”<br><br>
            Rawsthorn cites this and other mundane behavior to show how technology has impacted design and how graphic, product, and interactive design are key in almost everything we experience today. It’s no wonder, then, that when Rawsthorn speaks, people who care about design’s influences listen. I recently exchanged emails with her to learn more about her mission to get the public to think more critically about design.<br><br>
            “Design is one of the most powerful forces in our lives, whether or not we are aware of it, and can also be inspiring, empowering and enlightening,” she explained to me. 16th-century Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde for example, “invented” the common equals sign when he had tired of writing the words “is equal to” and sought a less onerous way of conveying their meaning. “Choosing a pair of parallel lines of equal length was an inspired solution, and a brilliant example of [graphic] design's power to solve a practical problem,” she wrote. “There are countless other examples of adroitly designed symbols, not all of which were designed from scratch. The digital incarnations of the hashtag and @ symbol are equally successful examples of design appropriation, rather than invention.”<br><br>
            Rawsthorn added, “It always astonishes me that so many people still fail to appreciate those qualities.” Maybe that includes editors at major publications that cover design routinely as part of a larger commercial eco-system. But Rawsthorn’s method is to look at intention and function first and then the commercial benefits second. “As a writer,” she continued, “I find design endlessly fascinating, because it is richly contextualized and constantly changing, forcing me to continually reassess my understanding of it.”<br><br>
            As the title of her book touts, the essays in Hello World: Where Design Meets Life evoke cautious optimism in the ability of designers to do the right thing. “Design should always be in the service of a better life, but, unfortunately, it does not always achieve that objective,” Rawsthorn noted. “We can all think of examples of design projects, even the best intentioned ones, which threaten to make our lives worse rather than better.<br><br>
            <h3>"I find the old-fashioned assumption that design is somehow inferior to art to be deeply damaging."</h3><br><br>
            “One of the most notorious examples is the design of the ballot cards for the 2000 U.S. presidential election in Palm Beach County, Florida,” Rawsthorn explained. “The design was changed in the interests of clarity and legibility, but proved so confusing to voters that it may well have changed the outcome not only of the vote there, but the entire election.”<br><br>
            Design can empower people, and for Rawsthorn, always striving to make design empowering is the ideal. But she concedes that disempowerment, like the case of the hanging chad, is also a consequence of unintentional factors. “I have yet to meet a designer who wants his or her work to be dysfunctional, dispiriting, demeaning, or disempowering, but sometimes it is,” she said. “Not that it is always their fault. Some design projects prove to be damaging because of the way in which they are applied. The computer virus was originally designed as a self-replicating form of software that could be installed remotely without the user’s knowledge, but it was not intended to be malignant. Quite the contrary. Sadly, though, it proved to be open to abuse and to create destructive viruses.”<br><br>
            Many designers are hard-wired to control their environment, so Rawsthorn accepts that design is often steeped in a yearning for power. “But that does not necessarily make it [malignant],” she noted. “Take an information design project, like a road signage system or a subway map, which is intended to be entirely beneficial by helping us to make sense of our surroundings and guiding us safely and efficiently from place to place, ensuring that we arrive at our chosen destination on time and unharmed. We are controlled by the design of the signage or map throughout that process, but in a benevolent way.”<br><br>
            Whether or not design is benevolent, Rawsthorn is careful not to use the word art to describe it. Her splendid essay "Why design is not—and should never be confused with—art" echoes what the modernist graphic designer Paul Rand said about art as a consequence, not an intention. Rawsthorn believes the notion of “Art = Good, Design = not so good” is an archaic idea; it is, “thankfully, an increasingly derided assumption,” she wrote. “I firmly believe in the individual's right to identify their work as they wish, whether as design, art, craft, anthropology, or whatever. That said, I find the old-fashioned assumption that design is somehow inferior to art to be deeply damaging.<br><br>
            <h3>"As digital products become ever more powerful and versatile, design has an important role to play in enabling us to use them confidently, efficiently and, if we're very lucky, enjoyably."</h3><br><br>
            “If you believe in design as a powerful and productive medium that can help to build a better life, it stands to reason that we need the best possible designers to do so,” she continued. “We are not likely to get them if design is seen as so marginal a discipline that its practitioners are eager to reclassify themselves as artists. Also, the richer, more diverse, and [more] inclusive design becomes, the more compelling it will seem, thereby enabling it to attract the high caliber of designers that society needs.”<br><br>
            Hello World covers design as an inclusive practice, so I was interested in how she defines the strength and weakness of today’s logos and marks. “Like all design endeavors, some logos are inherently good, and others inherently bad, depending on the quality of their design,” Rawsthorn wrote. “The specifics vary from case to case, but broadly speaking, if a logo communicates the desired message clearly, ideally engagingly, and—critically—honestly, it can be deemed to be well designed.” Whenever she sees one of Rand’s logos for IBM, ABC, and UPS, for instance, she finds them “invariably clear, engaging, and honest.<br><br>
            “Whereas, when I see the sunflower symbol, with which BP sought to convince us that it is a sensitive, environmentally responsible oil company," she explained, "I think of the tragic consequences of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.”<br><br>
            Rawsthorn acts as design’s agent provocateur, throwing little bombs that unsettle the status quo. Take, for example, the modernist chestnut that form must follow function: I asked her to explain her contrary position that “form no longer follows function,” if indeed design's goal is functionality? “Form can still be considered to follow function for many analog objects, especially ones that are pure forms—like chairs, spoons, or knives—because it is helpful if their physical appearance gives us clues as to how to use them,” she responded.<br><br>
            “But it would not only be unhelpful, but impossible for the form of tiny digital devices like smart phones or tablet computers to follow, or articulate their multiple functions. Instead," she explained, "we find the same clues in the design of their user interfaces and the operating software that enables us to use them. As these digital products become ever more powerful and versatile, design has an increasingly important role to play in enabling us to use them confidently, efficiently and, if we're very lucky, enjoyably.” <br><br>
