<strong>"The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-follows function is reconfigured as form-follows-content."</strong><br><br>
Relates article The Demise of Form Follows Function by Alice Rawsthornmay<br><br>
Form follows function is a key idea in Fuck content and the related article, both believe that content is not the most important aspect of a design but instead the focus needs to be on the design elements.    <br><br><br><br>

	<strong>"Designers also trade in storytelling. The elements we must master are not the content narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale, weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines."</strong><br><br>
	Relates article The Art of Type: Reading Between the Lines by James Felici<br><br>
	Fuck content discusses how designers must master design elements to deliver a message rather than relying on the content to do so. The related article specifically focuses on mastering typography to improve the readability of a piece.<br><br><br><br>

	<strong>"Form has evolved dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. Stellar examples of graphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or machinery."</strong><br><br>
	Relates article The Science of How Marketers (and Politicians) Manipulate Us by Kit Yarrow<br><br>
	The idea that graphic designers can use their creativity to persuade and change the way people view products and the world is similar to the related article that discusses in detail the persuasive techniques used by marketers.<br><br><br><br>

	TL;DR
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="title4">
	Design elements such as typography, line, form and color are essential when creating a well designed piece rather than the focus being purely on its content. It is not the content that is the focal point that manipulates and changes the way a product or idea is viewed but rather the way in which the designers have manipulated imagery. <br><br><br><br>
</div>
<div class="title3">
	idea
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="title4">
The idea is to create a simple uncluttered webpage that has a variety of elements to engage the viewer, as the content is not the only important aspect.  The articles are all on the one page and are accessed by scrolling across as the articles follow on sequentially. Although the article fuck content discuses that content is said to play only a minor part, it is still important for the design to have purpose.  <br><br><br><br>
