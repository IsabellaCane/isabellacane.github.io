<em>I BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DESIGN</em>
PROBLEM YOU NEED TO SOLVE,
<em>YOU SHOULD FACE IT WITH</em>
RATIONALITY, LOGIC AND CAREFUL
<em>ANALYSIS IF YOU WANT TO</em>
GET TO THE RIGHT IDEA.
<em>GRAPHIC DESIGN IS ALWAYS</em>
A SYNTHETIC WORK:YOU NEED TO
<em>REDUCE AND REMOVE UNTIL</em>
YOU REACH THE CORE OF THE
<em>MESSAGE. WHEN YOU WORK</em>
WITH TYPOGRAPHY AND LETTERING,
<em>THE ESSENTIAL GOAL IS TO</em>
OBTAIN THE BEST POSSIBLE
<em>LEGIBILITY. TO ACHIEVE THIS</em>
RESULT, IT IS FUNDAMENTAL
<em>TO KNOE TYPOGRAPHY AND ITS</em>
HISTORY.THE COMPUTER HAS
<em>BECOME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL</em>
BUT ITS UNDISPUTED UTILITY
<em>AND VERSATILITY CANNOT REPLACE</em>
KNOWLEDGE. AS EXTRORDINARY
<em>AS THIS INSTRUMENT CAN BE, YOU</em>
NEED DEEP ROOTS AND THE ABILITY
<em>TO EXPRESS YOURSELF EVEN WITH</em>
THE SIMPLEST TOOLS-SUCH AS A
<em>PENCIL-IN ORDER TO USE IT CORRECTLY.</em>
A GOOD SOFTWARE DOES NOT
<em>NECESSARILY CREATE GOOD GRAPHICS.</em>
