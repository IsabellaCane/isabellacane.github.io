I BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DESIGN PROBLEM YOU NEED TO SOLVE, YOU SHOULD FACE
<br>
IT WITH RATIONALITY, LOGIC AND CAREFUL ANALYSIS IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE
<br>
RIGHT IDEA.
<br>
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT, IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO KNOW
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TYPOGRAPHY AND ITS HISTORY.THE COMPUTER HAS BECOME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ESSENTIAL TOOL BUT ITS UNDISPUTED UTILITY AND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VERSATILITY CANNOT REPLACE KNOWLEDGE. AS EXTRAORDINARY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS THIS INSTRUMENT CAN BE, YOU NEED DEEP ROOTS AND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF EVEN WITH THE SIMPLEST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOOLS—SUCH AS A PENCIL—IN ORDER TO USE IT CORRECTLY.
<br>
<br>
<br>

A GOOD DESIGNER IS THE ONE WHO OFFERS A GOOD SERVICE THROUGH COMMUNICATION, NOT THE
<br>
ONE WHO WANTS TO SURPRISE AT ANY COST, NEITHER THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SHOW HOW GOOD HE IS.
