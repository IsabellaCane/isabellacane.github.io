I BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DESIGN PROBLEM YOU NEED TO SOLVE, YOU SHOULD FACE
<br>
IT WITH RATIONALITY, LOGIC AND CAREFUL ANALYSIS IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE
<br>
RIGHT IDEA.
<br>
<br>
<br>

TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT, IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO KNOW TYPOGRAPHY AND ITS HISTORY.
<br>
THE COMPUTER HAS BECOME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL BUT ITS UNDISPUTED UTILITY AND
<br>
VERSATILITY CANNOT REPLACE KNOWLEDGE. AS EXTRAORDINARY AS THIS INSTRUMENT CAN
<br>
BE, YOU NEED DEEP ROOTS AND THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF EVEN WITH THE
<br>
SIMPLEST TOOLS—SUCH AS A PENCIL—IN ORDER TO USE IT CORRECTLY.
<br>
<br>
<br>

A GOOD DESIGNER IS THE ONE WHO OFFERS A GOOD SERVICE THROUGH COMMUNICATION,
<br>
NOT THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SURPRISE AT ANY COST, NEITHER THE ONE WHO
<br>
WANTS TO SHOW HOW GOOD HE IS.
