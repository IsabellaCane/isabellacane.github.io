&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DESIGN PROBLEM YOU NEED TO SOLVE, YOU SHOULD FACE IT WITH
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RATIONALITY, LOGIC AND CAREFUL ANALYSIS IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE RIGHT IDEA.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRAPHIC DESIGN IS ALWAYS A SYNTHETIC WORK: YOU NEED TO REDUCE AND REMOVE UNTIL YOU
