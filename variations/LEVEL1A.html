		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, whatever design
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem you need to solve,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you should face it with
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rationality, logic and careful
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis if you want to
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get to the right idea.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphic design is always
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a synthetic work: you need to
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduce and remove until
		you reach the core of the 
		message. When you work
		with typography and lettering,
		the essential goal is to
		obtain the best possible
		legibility. To achieve this
		result, it is fundamental
		to know typography and its
		history. The computer has
		become an essential tool
		but its undisputed utility
		and versatility cannot replace
		knowledge. As extraordinary
		as this instrument can be, you
		need deep roots and the ability
		to express yourself even with
		the simplest tools—such as a
		pencil—in order to use it correctly.
		A good software does not
		necessarily create good graphics.
